In Solano County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the mid-20s around 2015 and then declined steadily over time. By 2019, the rate had fallen into the high teens, and it continued dropping into the mid-teens by the early 2020s. The forecast suggests this downward trend will persist through the late 2020s and into the early 2030s, with misdemeanor rates sliding from the low teens to very low single digits and effectively approaching zero by the end of the period. The blue band is moderately wide, but even its upper edge stays below the mid-2010s levels, indicating that substantially lower misdemeanor rates are expected going forward.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents in Solano County began at about 10 in 2015–2017, then gradually declined into the mid-8s by 2019 and the low-8s to high-7s in the early 2020s. After a brief plateau in the mid-6s to high-6s around the mid-2020s and a small bump in the late 2020s, the projections show a clearer drop, with felony rates falling into the mid-5s by around 2031 and settling in the low-4s by the early 2030s. The confidence interval is relatively narrow throughout, and it remains below the starting values, suggesting a stable long-term decline in felony rates for Solano County.
