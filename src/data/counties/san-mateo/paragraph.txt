In San Mateo County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the high teens around 2015–2016 and dipped slightly into the mid-teens by 2017. They then hovered in the mid- to high-teens through the late 2010s before dropping sharply around 2020, followed by a rebound into the mid-teens again in the early 2020s. From there, the forecast shows a gradual decline, with misdemeanor rates easing from the mid-teens in the mid-2020s to the low-teens by the late 2020s and then into the high single digits by the early 2030s. There are small projected bumps around 2029 and 2033, but the blue band stays below the earlier levels, suggesting a general long-term downward trend in misdemeanors.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents start just under 5 in 2015 and remain very stable through the late 2010s and early 2020s, fluctuating only slightly around the mid-4s. After the mid-2020s, the projections indicate a modest decline, with felony rates edging down from the mid-4s to the high-3s by the late 2020s. The forecast then shows a repeating pattern of small dips and rebounds through the early 2030s, but staying in a narrow band between the mid-3s and mid-4s. The uncertainty range is moderate but centered around this relatively flat path, indicating that San Mateo County is expected to maintain low and fairly stable felony rates over time.
