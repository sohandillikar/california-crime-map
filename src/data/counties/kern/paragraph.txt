Kern County has recently reported about 16 to 18 misdemeanors per 1,000 residents and around 10 to 11 total felonies per 1,000. This places the county among those with higher crime rates, especially for felonies. Since 2015, misdemeanor rates have dropped significantly, falling from nearly 40 per 1,000, and are expected to reach the low teens per 1,000 over the next four years. This is a stronger improvement than what we see in many other counties. However, felony rates have remained high and somewhat unstable in the low teens, with forecasts showing only a slow decline to about 9 per 1,000 in the same period.The progress in reducing misdemeanors but continued high and unstable felony rates would mean Kern is likely to stay among the counties with more serious crime concerns even if its overall trend is better than it was a decade ago.
