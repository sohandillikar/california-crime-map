In Mariposa County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started out fairly high, in the upper 20s during 2015 and 2016. They then declined slowly through 2019 and 2020, before dropping more quickly around 2021. After that, the model predicts misdemeanors will keep falling through the late 2020s and early 2030s, reaching the mid-single digits by the early 2030s and just a few cases per 1,000 by 2034. While the forecast becomes less certain further into the future, it still suggests there will be far fewer misdemeanors than in the mid-2010s. Overall, Mariposa is expected to see a clear long-term drop in misdemeanors and a moderate decline in felonies.
