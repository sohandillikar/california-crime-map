In Madera County, misdemeanors per 1000 residents started in the low 20s in 2015, increased slightly from 2018 to 2021, and then began a gradual decline through the mid-2020s into the early 2030s. The forecast shows misdemeanors generally dropping from the low 20s to the mid or high teens by the early 2030s. However, the wide blue band on the chart shows there is a lot of uncertainty, so future rates could end up anywhere from the low teens to the mid 20s depending on how things change. Total felonies per 1000 residents were in the high 7s to low 8s around 2015, rose briefly near 2017 and again around 2021, and then leveled off and drifted slightly downward, settling in the mid 7s in the projections. Overall, Madera is expected to have fairly stable but slowly declining felony rates.
