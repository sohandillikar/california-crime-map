In Santa Clara County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the mid-teens around 2015 and then declined steadily through the late 2010s and early 2020s, falling into the low teens and then just under 10 per 1,000 by about 2023–2024. The forecast shows this downward trend continuing through the late 2020s, with misdemeanors dropping into the mid-single digits and then to very low single digits by the early 2030s. There is a small projected bump around 2029 and again near 2033, but the blue confidence interval remains well below the original mid-teens levels, indicating an overall expectation of substantially lower misdemeanor rates over time.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents in Santa Clara County are comparatively stable. They begin around the mid-5s in 2015, fluctuate slightly but remain in a narrow range between roughly 5.2 and 5.8 through the observed years, with a modest rise in the early 2020s followed by a gentle dip toward the mid-2020s. Looking ahead, the projections keep felony rates hovering near the mid-5s with some small ups and downs into the early 2030s, including bumps around 2029 and 2033. The confidence interval is moderate in width but centered around a nearly flat path, suggesting that felony rates are expected to remain relatively steady rather than showing a strong long-term increase or decline.
