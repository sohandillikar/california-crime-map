In San Bernardino County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the low-to-mid-20s around 2015 and then trended steadily downward. By the late 2010s, rates had slipped into the high teens, and they continued to fall through the early 2020s, reaching the low teens by about 2023. The forecast shows this decline continuing through the late 2020s and into the 2030s, with misdemeanors dropping from the low teens to only a few incidents per 1,000 residents and approaching zero by the end of the period. The blue confidence interval is fairly wide in the later years, but even its upper edge stays well below the higher levels seen in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents begin in the low-12s around 2015 and follow a gradual downward path over time. Rates fall into the high-10s by the end of the decade, move into the mid-9s and high-8s in the early 2020s, and are projected to continue easing into the mid-7s by the late 2020s. From there, the forecast suggests a further decline into the mid-6s by the early 2030s, with only small year-to-year fluctuations. Overall, both misdemeanor and felony rates in San Bernardino County are expected to show a sustained long-term decrease.
