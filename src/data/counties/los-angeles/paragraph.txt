In Los Angeles County, misdemeanors per 1000 people were in the high teens around 2015 and slowly declined through 2019 and 2020. After that, the rate dropped more sharply, reaching about 10 per 1000 by 2023. Forecasts show this decline continuing through the late 2020s and into the 2030s, with rates expected to fall to very low single digits or near zero by the end of the period. The uncertainty range stays well below the earlier levels. For felonies, the rate per 1000 started in the mid-7s in 2015 and stayed mostly flat, with a slight downward trend into the mid-6s by the early 2020s. After the mid-2020s, the rate drops more clearly, reaching the mid-4s by the late 2020s and staying in that lower range into the early 2030s. There are small projected increases around 2029 and 2033, but these remain below earlier years. Overall, both misdemeanor and felony rates show a steady long-term decline.
