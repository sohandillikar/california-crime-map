In Yolo County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the mid-20s around 2015 and then trended steadily downward, moving into the high teens by the late 2010s and the low-to-mid teens by the early 2020s. There is a small uptick around 2023–2024, but the forecast shows the broader decline continuing through the late 2020s and into the 2030s. By the early 2030s, misdemeanor rates are projected to fall to very low single digits and effectively approach zero by the end of the period. The blue confidence interval widens in the later years, yet it stays well below the higher levels seen in the mid-2010s.

For total felonies, Yolo County began in the high 8s to low 9s per 1,000 residents in 2015 and then showed a fairly smooth, gradual decline. Rates fall into the mid-7s by the late 2010s, slide into the mid-5s by the mid-2020s, and are projected to reach the low 4s around 2030 and the low 2s by the early 2030s. The forecast band is relatively narrow and remains entirely below the starting values, indicating a consistent long-term downward trend in felony rates with no major rebounds expected.
