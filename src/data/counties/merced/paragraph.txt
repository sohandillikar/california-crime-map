In Merced County, misdemeanor arrests per 1,000 residents were in the mid-20s around 2015. Since then, they have steadily declined, reaching the mid-teens by the early 2020s and continuing to fall in the forecast. The trend line eventually goes below zero in the distant future, which does not have a real-world meaning but shows how strong the downward trend is. There is a small projected increase to the high-8s around 2028, but the rate is expected to fall again to between 5 and 6 by the early 2030s. Overall, Merced County is expected to see a long-term drop in both misdemeanor and felony arrest rates.
