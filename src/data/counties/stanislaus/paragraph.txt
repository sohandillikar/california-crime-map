In Stanislaus County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the mid-20s in 2015–2016 and stayed fairly stable through the late 2010s, with values mostly in the mid-20s to high-20s. Around 2021–2022, the rate drops more noticeably into the low 20s and then briefly into the mid-teens before rebounding back toward the low 20s by the mid-2020s. The forecast shows misdemeanors hovering in the low-20s through the late 2020s, followed by a gradual decline into the mid- to high-teens by the early 2030s. The blue confidence interval is fairly wide, suggesting that future misdemeanor rates could range from the low-teens to the mid-20s, but overall, the projections point to slightly lower levels than those seen in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents start in the mid-teens around 2015–2016 and show a step-down pattern over time. Rates fall into the high-11s by 2017–2018, then into the low-10s by around 2020, and the observed values in the early 2020s are in the high-9 to low-10 range. Looking ahead, the forecast indicates a gradual but steady decline, with felony rates moving from the high-9s in the mid-2020s to the mid-7s by around 2029 and then into the mid-5s to low-6s by the early 2030s. The confidence interval stays relatively narrow and remains below earlier levels, indicating that Stanislaus County is expected to experience a continued long-term decrease in felony rates.
