In Siskiyou County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the high 30s around 2015 and remained in the mid- to upper-30s through the late 2010s. After 2019, the rate began to drift downward, reaching the low 30s by the early 2020s. The forecast shows this decline continuing through the mid-2020s and into the 2030s, with misdemeanors gradually moving from the low 30s into the low 20s and high teens by the end of the period. There are small projected bumps around 2029 and again in the early 2030s, but the blue confidence interval stays below the earlier peak levels, suggesting that future misdemeanor rates are still expected to be lower than in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents in Siskiyou County start in the mid-teens around 2015–2016 and then decline into the low-teens by 2019–2020. There is a noticeable spike in the early 2020s, when felony rates briefly climb back toward the high-teens, followed by a return to single-digit levels by 2023–2024. Looking ahead, the fitted line projects a continued downward trend, with felonies dropping from the high single digits in the mid-2020s to the mid-single digits by the late 2020s and eventually to only a few incidents per 1,000 residents in the early 2030s, with a modest rebound around 2029 before declining again. Overall, despite some short-term fluctuations, both observed data and forecasts point to a long-run reduction in felony rates.
