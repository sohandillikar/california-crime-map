In Nevada County, misdemeanor rates per 1,000 residents fluctuated slightly through 2018 and 2019, and then declined to the low teens by the early 2020s. Projections indicate this downward trend will continue, with misdemeanors expected to reach single-digit levels by the late 2020s and approach near zero by the mid-2030s. Felony rates began at approximately 7 to 8 per 1,000 in 2015 and generally decreased by the early 2020s. The forecast suggests felony rates will decline further, potentially reaching 1 per 1,000 and nearing zero by the 2030s. These trends indicate that Nevada County is likely to experience significant reductions in both misdemeanors and felonies over the next decade.
