Humboldt County has had higher crime rates than most mid-range counties, with past years showing about 40 to 45 misdemeanors and 11 to 13 felonies per 1,000 residents. Over the last decade, misdemeanors have steadily dropped to the low 30s per 1,000, while felonies have varied but are now closer to 10 per 1,000. This points to some improvement, though felony rates remain high. The model predicts misdemeanors will keep falling, possibly reaching the mid to high teens per 1,000 in four years. Felonies are also expected to decline into the high single digits, but the forecast shows some ups and downs, so there is still some uncertainty. Overall, Humboldt still has higher crime rates than counties like Glenn or Contra Costa, but if these trends continue, it could move closer to the state average.
