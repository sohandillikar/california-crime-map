At approximately 1314 misdemeanors per 1000 and about 612 total felonies per 1000, Calaveras County is currently in a moderately high range of counties, lower than such as Butte but not the lowest counties. Misdemeanors have experienced a relatively consistent decrease in rates since the mid-20s of 1000 in 2015 and fell to the mid-6s, followed by a more flattened trend with a small recent increase. In the next four years, the model forecasts that misdemeanors would keep falling in the high single digits per 1,000, but felonies would remain roughly constant at their level and then fall further further in the long-run forecast. To sum up, Calaveras seems to be improving steadily, particularly on misdemeanors, however, its rate on felonies is still firmly in the middle.
