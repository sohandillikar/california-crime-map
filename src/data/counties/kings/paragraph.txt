Initially, Kings County had high crime rates, with about 40 misdemeanors and 13 felonies per 1,000 residents. Since then, both numbers have dropped steadily. The latest data show misdemeanors in the mid-20s per 1,000 and felonies around 8 to 9 per 1,000. While crime is still higher than in some counties, it is clearly lower than it was ten years ago. The forecast predicts this downward trend will continue, with misdemeanors expected to fall to the mid-teens per 1,000 and felonies to about 5 or 6 per 1,000 over the next four years. If these projections are accurate, Kings County will move from being a high-crime area to more of an average one. In short, crime levels in Kings are still elevated but improving, and the county could soon be noticeably safer compared to others.
