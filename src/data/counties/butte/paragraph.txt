Butte County has presently rather high crime rates as opposed to those of the other counties that we examined, and current values are approximately 2830 misdemeanors per 1,000 residents. Misdemeanors have been steadily dropping to the high-30s/low-40s per 1,000 in 2015, whereas the felonies have been decreasing slowly and gradually, about 10 per 1,000, over the same time. The projections are that the misdemeanor rates will continue to decline continuously within the next ten years by up to the low-teens per 1,000, but the felony rates are projected to remain the same even after four years. This county’s overall trend is a positive one but can be chosen as having one of the highest rates of misdemeanors on the list, particularly the felony ones.
