Glenn County now reports about 16 to 18 misdemeanors and 3 to 4 felonies per 1,000 residents. This puts the county’s misdemeanor rate in the middle range and its felony rate on the lower end compared to other counties. Since 2015, both rates have dropped a lot. Misdemeanors fell from the mid-30s per 1,000, and felonies dropped from around 11 or 12 per 1,000 to where they are now. Looking ahead, misdemeanors are expected to fall into the low teens per 1,000 over the next four years, and felonies may drop to very low single digits. If this continues, Glenn County will be one of the safer counties for serious crime. The long-term forecast goes slightly below zero, but that is not realistic and just shows the limits of using a straight-line prediction in a small county. Overall, the trend shows Glenn County has made big improvements in the past decade and is likely to keep felony rates low and see misdemeanor rates continue to improve.
