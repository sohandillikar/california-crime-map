Mendocino County’s misdemeanor and felony data are somewhat of an anomaly. There is a very slight downward trend in felonies in the years preceding the pandemic, and no noticeable trend in misdemeanors. There is an expected drop in 2020 due to the pandemic like all other counties, but a further steep drop in 2022, before appearing to return to pandemic levels in 2024. There is no available information on any potential causes for these anomalous past three years in the data. Overall, if we were to take this data at face value, then the county is projected to see a further downward trend in misdemeanor and felonies, but the anomalous data makes any conclusion uncertain.
