The current number of total felonies in Amador County is approximately 6 per 1,000 residents of the county and the number of misdemeanors is about 11 per 1,000 residents, which places the county in an intermediate rank among the other California counties. This is lower than the lowest crime rural counties but also, significantly, lower than the larger urban counties. The rates of both a felony and a misdemeanor have since 2015 steadily decreased, with approximately 10 felonies and 1718 misdemeanors per 1,000 people, and no significant spikes up or down. This negative trend is predicted to persist within the next four years, both are expected to decline further into the distinctly lower range at the end of the forecast. An interesting aspect is the steeper estimated decline in felonies later in 2020s which means that Amador can become relatively safer in the future.
