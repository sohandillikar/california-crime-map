In San Diego County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the low 20s around 2015–2016, then trended downward through the late 2010s, settling in the mid-to-high teens by 2019–2020. Around 2021, there is a sharp drop into the single digits, followed by a partial rebound, with rates in the low teens again by the early 2020s. The forecast shows misdemeanors gradually declining from roughly the low teens in the mid-2020s to only a few incidents per 1,000 residents by the early 2030s, with the confidence interval widening but staying well below the levels seen in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents start around 7 in 2015–2016 and drift slightly downward through 2017–2018 before flattening out in the mid-6s by 2019–2020. In 2021, the observed rate dips noticeably, then climbs back into the low-5s and upper-5s over the next few years. Looking ahead, the projections keep felonies in a relatively narrow range: they hover around the mid-5s through the late 2020s, then step down into the mid-4s and finally into the high-3s by the early 2030s. The blue band is moderately wide but remains centered below the initial values, suggesting a gradual long-term easing of felony rates in San Diego County.
