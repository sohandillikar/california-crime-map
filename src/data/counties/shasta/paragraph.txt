In Shasta County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were around the mid-40s in 2015, dipped into the high 30s by the late 2010s, and then moved back into the low 40s in the early 2020s, with a noticeable spike above 50 per 1,000 around 2024. The forecast keeps misdemeanor rates generally in the low-40s to mid-40s through the late 2020s and early 2030s, suggesting a slight upward drift rather than a decline. However, the blue band around the forecast is quite wide—often spanning from the mid-30s to around 50—indicating a high degree of uncertainty about how misdemeanor levels will actually evolve.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents start in the low-teens around 2015–2017, fluctuate slightly, and then show a gradual but steady decline. By the mid-2020s, felony rates fall into the high single digits, and the projections suggest they will continue easing down into the mid-single digits by the early 2030s. The confidence interval is moderate and remains centered below the earlier levels, indicating that Shasta County is expected to see a continued long-term reduction in felony rates even as misdemeanor rates stay relatively high and somewhat variable.
