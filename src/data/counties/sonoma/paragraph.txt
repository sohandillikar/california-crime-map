In Sonoma County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the mid-20s in 2015–2016 and stayed in the mid-20s to high-20s through the late 2010s, with a small bump around 2018–2019. Around 2020–2021, the rate drops more noticeably into the upper-teens and then continues drifting downward. The forecast shows this decline persisting through the late 2020s and into the 2030s, with misdemeanor rates expected to fall from the mid-teens in the mid-2020s to the high single digits or low teens by the early 2030s. The blue confidence interval widens over time but remains well below the earlier mid-20s levels, suggesting that, despite some variation, future misdemeanor rates are likely to stay lower than in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents in Sonoma County begin around the high-6s in 2015–2016 and fluctuate only slightly over the observed period, generally staying between about 6½ and 7¼ through the early 2020s, with a brief dip in 2020 and a small rise again around 2023. Looking ahead, the projections keep felony rates fairly stable: they edge down a bit into the high-5s by the late 2020s, then move back toward the low-6s with some modest ups and downs into the early 2030s. The confidence interval is relatively wide but centered around this narrow range, indicating that Sonoma is expected to maintain roughly steady felony rates over the long term rather than experiencing a sharp increase or decrease.
