In San Joaquin County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started around 20–21 in 2015 and then declined steadily across the observed years. By the early 2020s, the rate had fallen into the low teens, and it continues drifting downward through the mid-2020s. The forecast shows this decline carrying on through the late 2020s and early 2030s, with misdemeanor rates expected to drop from the low teens to very low single digits and effectively approach zero by the end of the period. The blue confidence interval is fairly wide in the out-years, but even the upper edge stays well below the mid-2010s levels, indicating that substantially lower misdemeanor rates are expected going forward.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents begin around 9–10 in 2015, fluctuate slightly with a small peak near 2017, and then show a gradual downward trend. By the early 2020s, the rate had slipped into the low-8s and then into the mid-7s; projections continue this decline through the mid-2020s, reaching the mid-6s to low-6s. After a modest bump around 2029 and again near 2033, the forecast keeps felony rates in the mid-5s by the early 2030s. The confidence interval remains moderate and entirely below the initial values, suggesting a steady long-term reduction in felony rates alongside the sharper decline in misdemeanors.
