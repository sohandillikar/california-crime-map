Inyo County has recently been at roughly 18–20 misdemeanors per 1,000 residents and around 10–11 total felonies per 1,000, which puts it in a moderately high range and not as extreme as places like Del Norte or Humboldt. Over the last decade, misdemeanors have declined from the high-20s and low-30s, and felonies have bounced up and down in the low-teens before starting a clear downward slide in the most recent years. The forecasts suggest that misdemeanors will keep falling into the low-teens per 1,000 over the next four years. Overall, Inyo looks like a county with somewhat elevated current crime rates but a generally improving trajectory.
