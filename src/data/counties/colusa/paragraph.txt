Currently, the county of Colusa has approximately 18 misdemeanors per 1,000 inhabitants and about 4-5 total felonies per 1,000, which means that the misdemeanor rate of the county is on the upper side of the mid-range, whereas the felony rate is on the lower-middle range in relation to other counties. Historically, the two measures have been very volatile annually and particularly that of misdemeanors. The model estimates that within four years these drops will keep on falling, with misdemeanors falling to the low teens per 1,000 and the felonies falling lower still to the negatives, which is an indicator of the fit of a simple line to noisy data and not a realistic forecast of zero crime. Overall, this indicates that Colusa is in the process of making a positive transition, although its long history of misdemeanors make it a high crime county.
