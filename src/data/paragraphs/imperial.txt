Imperial County began with moderately high crime rates, about 25 to 27 misdemeanors per 1,000 residents and around 11 to 14 felonies per 1,000. Over the last decade, both numbers have dropped sharply. In recent years, misdemeanors have fallen to about 11 to 12 per 1,000, and felonies to about 4 to 5 per 1,000. This puts Imperial County in the middle or just below the middle compared to other counties you have reviewed. Forecasts suggest this downward trend will continue. Misdemeanors are expected to fall into the single digits per 1,000 within four years, and felonies into the very low single digits. The long-term projection even dips below zero, which is not realistic but shows how steep the decline is. Overall, Imperial County started with higher crime rates but can possibly become one of the counties with the lowest felony rates.
