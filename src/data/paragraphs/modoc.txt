In Modoc County, observed misdemeanor rates per 1,000 residents start relatively high in 2015–2017 with some year-to-year volatility, then drop sharply around 2021 and settle into the low-20s by 2022–2023. The projection suggests a brief plateau in the low-20s through the mid-2020s, followed by a steady decline so that by the early 2030s misdemeanors are expected to fall into the low teens. Felony rates begin the period elevated as well and then trend consistently downward through the early 2020s. Therefore, there is a continued improvement with lower overall crime rates for this county.
