In Trinity County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the mid-20s to low-30s around 2015–2016, then began a steady decline. By the late 2010s, they had fallen into the low-20s, and by the early 2020s, they were down to the mid-teens. The forecast shows this downward trend continuing through the late 2020s and into the 2030s, with misdemeanor rates moving into the low single digits and effectively approaching zero by the end of the period. The blue band around the line is fairly wide in the later years, but even the upper end stays well below the higher levels seen in the mid-2010s, indicating that substantially lower misdemeanor rates are expected going forward.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents start even higher, in the low-20s around 2015, and then decline sharply and almost continuously over time. By the mid-2020s, felony rates drop into the mid-single digits. The projections continue this pattern, with the fitted line trending toward zero and below by the early 2030s, again reflecting the model’s strong expectation of very low felony levels in the long run. Although the confidence interval widens, it still points to a sustained, long-term decrease in felony crime rates for Trinity County.
