Fresno County has approximately 15-17 misdemeanors per 1000 individuals and also approximately 10 felonies per 1000, hence it is in that high-crime group, particularly in terms of felony, than the other counties that you have checked. The misdemeanors have reduced considerably, as it was about 30 per 1,000 in 2015, and it is predicted to decrease further in the next four years to the low-teens per 1,000, so that part of the picture is certainly improving. On the other hand, the rate of felony has remained relatively stable, at 9-10 per 1,000, and the future prognosis keeps them there at the same high standards, with a slender range of uncertainty and no indication that they will decrease. Therefore, Fresno remains among the more concerning counties in general, despite the fact that its crime narrative is shifting in the right direction in part.
