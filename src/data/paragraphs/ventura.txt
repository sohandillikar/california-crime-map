In Ventura County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the high 20s to around 30 in 2015–2016. They stayed near the high 20s through the late 2010s, with a small bump around 2018–2019, and then began a steady decline. By the early 2020s, the rate had fallen into the low 20s, and it continues downward in the mid-2020s. The forecast shows misdemeanors dropping from the high teens in the mid-2020s into the low teens and then single digits by the early 2030s, with a brief uptick around 2029 before resuming the decline. The blue band is moderately wide, suggesting some uncertainty, but it still points to future misdemeanor rates remaining well below the levels observed in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents in Ventura County begin in the low 8s around 2015 and show a gradual downward trend through the late 2010s and early 2020s, settling into the mid-7s and then the mid-6s by the mid-2020s. Looking ahead, the projections indicate a continued decrease through the late 2020s, reaching the low-5 range before a small bump around 2029, and then easing back into the mid-4s to low-5s by the early 2030s. The confidence interval remains relatively narrow and stays below earlier values, indicating that Ventura is expected to maintain generally declining felony rates over the long run.
