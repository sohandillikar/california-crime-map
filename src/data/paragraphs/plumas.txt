In Plumas County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the mid-30s around 2015 and stayed in that high range through the late 2010s, with a gradual decline into the upper 20s and low 20s by 2019–2021. After 2021, the rate falls more sharply: observed values drop into the high teens and then single digits by the mid-2020s. The forecast continues that steep downward path through the late 2020s and early 2030s, with the line approaching zero and then dipping slightly below, which effectively signals very low or near-zero misdemeanor levels by the end of the period. The blue band widens as time goes on, but even its upper edge trends strongly downward from the earlier peak in the 30s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents begin just above 10 in 2015, fluctuate slightly in the high single digits to low teens through about 2018, and then follow a steady decline. By the early 2020s, felony rates had moved into the mid-single digits, and they dropped to around 1 per 1,000 by 2024. The projections show this decline continuing past zero in the later 2020s and early 2030s, again best interpreted as rates falling to essentially zero rather than truly negative values. Overall, both misdemeanor and felony trends in Plumas County point to a strong long-term decrease from relatively high mid-2010s levels to very low projected rates in the 2030s.
