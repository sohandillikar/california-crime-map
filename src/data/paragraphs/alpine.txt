Alpine County began the period with quite high misdemeanor rates, 35 to 40 per 1,000, and felony rates in the low to mid-teens per 1,000, very high by the standards of other larger counties. Both series exhibit a very strong downward trend since 2015. The model estimates the same reduction to the next four years, with the misdemeanors and felonies falling into the single-digit range per 1,000 range, suggesting that Alpine might shift to the lower-crime side of the spectrum. The most interesting aspect of Alpine graphs is the large year to year volatility and wide prediction band, particularly in felonies. This may be due to the fact that the population there is very small, and a few additional cases can dramatically change the per-capita rate. Overall, Alpine seems to be rapidly declining, relative to the previous per-capita rates.
