Lake County still has fairly high crime rates. Misdemeanors are in the high 20s to low 30s per 1,000 residents, and felonies are about 10 to 11 per 1,000. This is higher than many other counties you have reviewed. However, both rates have been dropping steadily since 2015, when misdemeanors were about 45 and felonies were 15 to 16 per 1,000. The model predicts that in the next four years, misdemeanors will fall to the high teens or low 20s per 1,000, and felonies will drop to the high single digits. This is an improvement, but still not as low as the best-performing counties. Unlike some smaller counties, Lake County has not seen big jumps or drops. Instead, crime has been slowly but steadily decreasing from a high starting point, and it is expected to remain a moderately high-crime county even after these improvements.
