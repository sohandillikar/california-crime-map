In Santa Barbara County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the mid- to high-40s around 2015 and then fell quickly, dropping into the mid-30s by 2017 and the high-20s to low-30s by the late 2010s. Through the early 2020s, the rate continued to decline into the low-20s, with a small bump around 2023 before resuming a steady downward path. The forecast shows misdemeanors sliding from the high teens in the mid-2020s into the low teens and then toward very low single digits by the early 2030s. The blue band around the forecast is fairly wide, especially in later years, suggesting that future misdemeanor levels could vary, but they are still expected to remain far below the levels seen in the mid-2010s.

For total felonies, the rate per 1,000 residents began in the mid-8s around 2015 and then declined gradually through the late 2010s and early 2020s, reaching the high-6s by 2022–2023. In the projections, felony rates flatten out in the high-6s through the mid-2020s, tick up slightly around 2027–2028, and then step down to about 6 per 1,000 around 2029. From there, they edge downward again, reaching the mid-5s by the early 2030s. The confidence interval is moderate and remains centered below the initial values, indicating a slow but persistent long-term decline in felony rates for Santa Barbara County.
