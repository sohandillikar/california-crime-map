In Tehama County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the high 30s to around 40 in 2015 and then declined fairly quickly into the high 20s by about 2017. Through the late 2010s, they stayed in the upper 20s to low 30s, before dropping again into the low 20s around 2020–2021. From the early 2020s, the rate levels off in the low 20s, but then the forecast shows a steady downward path: misdemeanors fall through the mid-teens in the mid-2020s, reach around 10 per 1,000 toward the late 2020s, and continue into the low single digits and near zero by the early 2030s. The blue band widens over time, indicating some uncertainty, but even the upper bound stays well below the high levels observed in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents begin in the high teens around 2015 and then drop sharply to roughly 10 by 2017. After that, felony rates remain relatively stable in the upper single digits through the early and mid-2020s. The projections suggest a gradual decline from these levels, with the fitted line sliding from about 7–8 per 1,000 in the mid-2020s down toward the mid-single digits by around 2030 and to only a few incidents per 1,000 residents by the early 2030s. The confidence interval is fairly broad but still points to future felony rates staying below their earlier peaks, indicating an overall long-term downward trend.
