In San Francisco County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started around 12 in 2015–2016, then dropped into the mid-9s by 2017 and stayed in the high-9s through 2018–2019. Around 2020–2021, the rate fell more sharply into the mid-7s and then hovered in the low- to mid-7s through the early 2020s, with only small year-to-year fluctuations. The forecast shows a steady decline from the mid-7s in the mid-2020s down into the mid-5s by the late 2020s and then into the low single digits by the early 2030s. The blue band widens toward the end of the period, but even its upper edge remains below the mid-2010s levels, indicating that misdemeanors are expected to stay well under their earlier highs.

For total felonies, the rate per 1,000 residents began in the high-8s around 2015–2016, then edged down into the high-7s by the late 2010s. After a sharper drop around 2020–2021 to roughly 6 per 1,000, there is a small uptick in the early 2020s, but the overall trend is downward. The projections suggest felonies will continue to decline from the mid-6s in the mid-2020s to the low-5s by around 2030 and into the high-4s by the early 2030s. The uncertainty range is moderate but consistently below the earlier peak values, pointing to a gradual, long-term reduction in felony rates in San Francisco County.
