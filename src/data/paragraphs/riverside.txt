In Riverside County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the mid-teens around 2015 and have generally trended downward. Through the late 2010s, the rate fell from the mid-teens into the low teens, then continued easing into the high single digits by the early 2020s. The forecast shows this gradual decline continuing, with misdemeanors sliding from the high single digits in the mid-2020s to around 5 per 1,000 by the early 2030s. The blue band around the forecast is moderately wide but slopes downward, indicating that while there is some uncertainty, future misdemeanor levels are expected to stay well below their mid-2010s values.

For total felonies, the rate per 1,000 residents begins just above 6 in 2015 and edges down slowly over the next several years, reaching the mid-5s by the early 2020s. After that, the projections show a mild upswing, with felony rates rising into the high-6s to around 7 per 1,000 in the late 2020s, followed by a sharp drop back into the mid-5s around 2029. A similar pattern appears again in the early 2030s, with a brief spike and then a return toward the mid-5s by the end of the forecast period. Overall, Riverside’s felony rates are expected to fluctuate within a relatively narrow band, with modest swings but no strong long-term increase or decrease, while misdemeanors show a clearer downward trend.
