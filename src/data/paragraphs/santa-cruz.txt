In Santa Cruz County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the low 30s around 2015 and then declined gradually over time. By the late 2010s, they had moved into the high 20s, and by the early 2020s, they were in the mid-20s. The forecast shows this downward trend continuing, with misdemeanor rates sliding into the high teens by the late 2020s and then into the low-to-mid teens by the early 2030s. There is a small projected bump around 2033, but the blue confidence interval still stays well below the early-period levels, suggesting that misdemeanors are expected to remain noticeably lower than in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents begin around the mid-8s in 2015–2017, then drift downward into the high-7s by 2019 and the high-6s to low-7s in the early 2020s, with a slight uptick around 2021–2022 before dropping more sharply after 2023. The projections show felony rates falling quickly to the mid-single digits by the mid-2020s and then to around 2 per 1,000 by the late 2020s, followed by modest rebounds and declines that keep them in the low single digits through the early 2030s. The confidence interval is relatively narrow and remains centered well below the starting values, indicating a strong long-term downward trend in felony rates for Santa Cruz County.
