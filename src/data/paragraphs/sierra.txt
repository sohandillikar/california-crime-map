In Sierra County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the low 20s around 2015–2016, then fell into the high teens by 2017. After a brief return to around 20 in 2018, the rate continued downward, dropping into the mid- to high-teens by 2019 and then sharply into the low teens around 2020–2022. By 2023, misdemeanors tick up slightly into the mid-teens. The forecast shows misdemeanors holding in the mid-teens through the mid-2020s and then gradually declining, reaching the high single digits by the early 2030s. The blue confidence interval is moderate in width, suggesting that future misdemeanor rates could vary but are still expected to remain below the higher levels seen in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents in Sierra County started quite high, in the mid-teens around 2015, and near 18–20 in 2016–2017. Since then, the rate has trended steadily downward, dropping into the low teens by 2018–2019, the high single digits around 2020, and the mid-single digits by the mid-2020s. The fitted line projects this decline continuing, with felony rates approaching zero by the late 2020s and staying at very low levels through the early 2030s. The confidence interval widens substantially in the later years, indicating that actual future rates could range from a few crimes per 1,000 residents to effectively zero, but in all cases remain well below the earlier peak levels.
