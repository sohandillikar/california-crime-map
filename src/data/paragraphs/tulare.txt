In Tulare County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the high 30s around 2015 and then declined fairly steadily over time. By the late 2010s, rates had moved down into the low 30s, then dropped into the mid-20s around 2020–2021 and the low 20s by the early 2020s. The forecast shows this downward trend continuing through the mid-2020s and into the 2030s, with misdemeanor rates expected to fall from the low 20s into the teens and eventually to only a few incidents per 1,000 residents by the early 2030s. The blue band becomes wider in later years, indicating some uncertainty, but it stays clearly below the higher levels observed in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents in Tulare County follow a similar pattern. They begin in the mid-teens around 2015 and decline gradually through the late 2010s, slipping into the low-teens by about 2020–2021 and then into the high single digits by the mid-2020s. Looking ahead, the projections suggest a continued slide, with felony rates falling from the mid-single digits in the late 2020s to low single digits by the early 2030s. Although the forecast band widens somewhat, it remains well below earlier values, indicating a sustained long-term decline in both misdemeanor and felony rates.
