Alameda County reports a little over 4 felonies and approximately 910 misdemeanors per 1,000 residents, both significantly lower than they were a decade ago when the rates were approximately 7 and almost 20 respectively. The statistics indicate a gradual, long-term change and do not include any significant fluctuations meaning that the state of public safety is improving steadily. This trend is continued in the 4-year projections, which predicts a 5 per 1,000 rate of felony and low single digit rates of misdemeanor, making Alameda one of the safer counties of large urban areas, although not the lowest. One of the peculiarities of the model is that misdemeanor forecasts cross zero at some point, this is not a real-life scenario, it only means that projected values are low, but not zero. In general, Alameda seems to be a relatively safe county that has been steadily improving over the years along with its counterparts.
