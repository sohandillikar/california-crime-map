In Placer County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the high teens around 2015–2017 and then began a steady downward slide through the late 2010s and early 2020s, falling into the low-teens by about 2023–2024. The forecasts show this decline continuing through the rest of the 2020s and into the early 2030s, with misdemeanor rates moving into the high single digits by the end of the period; the confidence interval narrows somewhat but remains tilted downward, keeping future values well below mid-2010s levels. Total felonies per 1,000 residents start in the upper-6 to low-7 range in 2015–2017, then drift slowly downward to the low-6s by the mid-2020s. After that, felony rates are projected to edge down a bit more, settling in the mid- to high-5s by the early 2030s, with most of the forecast range staying close to this gently declining path. Overall, Placer County is expected to experience gradual, long-term reductions in both misdemeanor and felony rates.
