In Yuba County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the high 20s to low 30s around 2015–2016, dipped into the mid-20s by 2017, and then climbed back toward the high 20s by 2019. After that, the rate fell into the low 20s and then the high teens around 2020–2022, before jumping back up into the mid- to high-20s in 2023. The forecast shows misdemeanors mostly fluctuating in the mid-20s through the late 2020s, with a small dip around 2029 and then a slide down into the low 20s by the early-to-mid 2030s. The blue band is fairly wide, indicating that future misdemeanor rates could range from the high teens to the upper 20s depending on how conditions evolve, but overall, the model suggests a generally stable pattern rather than a sharp long-term increase or decrease.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents in Yuba County start in the mid-teens around 2015 and then drift downward, reaching roughly 10 per 1,000 by the early 2020s. After 2023, the fitted line shows a much clearer decline, with felony rates projected to fall steadily through the late 2020s and into the 2030s, dropping to only a few incidents per 1,000 residents and potentially approaching zero by the end of the forecast period. Although the confidence interval widens somewhat in the later years, it remains well below the levels seen in the mid-2010s. Overall, misdemeanors are expected to remain relatively steady with some ups and downs, while felony rates show a strong long-term downward trend.
