In Orange County, both felony and misdemeanor crime rates per 1,000 residents are projected to decline overall, but at different rates. Felony rates start around the mid-5s in 2015 and drift gradually downward, with only modest fluctuations and brief upticks in the late 2020s and early 2030s, indicating a generally stable but slightly improving serious-crime picture. Misdemeanor rates, by contrast, show a clearer and more substantial drop—from roughly 20+ incidents per 1,000 in the mid-2010s to the low-teens by the 2030s—suggesting sustained reductions in lower-level offenses over time. Taken together, the projections imply that Orange County can expect continued, incremental improvement in overall crime, driven primarily by declines in misdemeanor offending while felony levels remain relatively low and slowly trending downward.
