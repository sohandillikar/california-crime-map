El Dorado County has approximately 15 to 16 misdemeanors per 1000 inhabitants and approximately 6 total felonies per 1000 so, it is not the highest crime areas such as Del Norte or Butte nor yet the lowest. Both of these measures have been experiencing a gradual downward trend since 2015, with the misdemeanors dropping to a small bit higher than 20 per 1,000 and the felonies dropping to the high-7s, but with occasional small bumps over the past few years instead of the downward-sloping smooth line. The four-year-old prognosis of the model indicates that misdemeanors will continue to slide down after a temporary plateau which will finally bring it into the range of the low-teens per 1,000. In conclusion, El Dorado is moderately safe now and on a generally improving course than many other counties.
