The crime burden in Del Norte County is higher in the sample with recent values of about 35-40 misdemeanors per 1,000 people and about 11-12 total felonies per 1,000 that is significantly higher than the other counties. In the last ten years, misdemeanors have remained at a high level with a slight downward trend whereas the felonies have fluctuated with peaks and declines consistently instead of a smooth down trend. This instability is reflected in the forecast with an expected decline in misdemeanor rates to the low to mid-twenties per thousand, and then an equal rise, but the felony rates are instead predicted to oscillate instead of continuing to move on a downward trend. The per-capita crime in Del Norte is not only high but also somewhat unpredictable, and it is probably due to the small population, because a small amount of incidents can shift the rates significantly.
