In San Benito County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the low 20s around 2015 and have trended steadily downward since then. Through the late 2010s and early 2020s, the rate declined into the mid- to high-teens, then continued easing into the low-teens by the mid-2020s. The forecast suggests this gradual decline will continue through the late 2020s and into the early 2030s, with misdemeanors expected to fall to the mid-single digits by the end of the period. The blue band widens over time, indicating some uncertainty, but even the upper bound stays well below the higher levels seen in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents began in the low-teens around 2015 and have followed a fairly smooth downward path. By the early 2020s, observed felony rates were already in the mid-single digits, and the projected line continues that decline, moving toward very low levels—near zero or even slightly below—by the early 2030s. The uncertainty range around the forecasts also slopes downward, suggesting that, while exact values may vary, San Benito County is expected to maintain substantially lower felony rates than in the past.
