In Tuolumne County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the low 30s around 2015–2016 and rose into the mid- to high-30s by 2017–2018. After that peak, the rate gradually declined, slipping back into the low 30s around 2020 and then into the high 20s and mid-20s by the mid-2020s. The forecast suggests this downward trend will generally continue, with misdemeanors expected to fall from the mid-20s in the mid-2020s toward the high teens and low 20s by the late 2020s and early 2030s, with a small bump around 2029 before easing down again. The blue band is fairly wide, indicating considerable uncertainty, so future misdemeanor rates could range from the mid-teens to the mid-20s, but overall, the projections point to lower levels than those seen in the late 2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents began in the mid-teens around 2015–2017, then trended slowly downward through the late 2010s, reaching the low teens by 2020–2021. After a brief leveling, rates dropped more clearly in the early 2020s, falling into the high single digits by the mid-2020s. The forecast continues this decline, with felony rates projected to move from the high single digits in the mid-2020s down into the mid- to low-single digits by the early 2030s. Although the confidence interval widens modestly over time, it remains below the mid-2010s levels, suggesting a steady long-term reduction in felony rates for Tuolumne County.
