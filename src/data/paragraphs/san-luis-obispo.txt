In San Luis Obispo County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the mid- to high-30s around 2015–2016 and then declined steadily, dropping into the low 30s by the late 2010s and the mid-20s by about 2020. By the early 2020s, rates had fallen into the low 20s. The forecast shows this downward trend continuing through the mid-2020s and into the 2030s, with misdemeanors expected to move from the high teens into single digits and then to very low levels by the end of the period. The blue band widens somewhat over time, but it remains well below the earlier levels, indicating that future misdemeanor rates are still projected to be much lower than in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents start around 6 in 2015–2017 and then drift downward, reaching the mid-5s by around 2019–2020 and the high-4s by the mid-2020s. After that, the projections show a modest hump, with felony rates rising back toward the high-5s in the late 2020s before dipping again into the mid-4s around 2029, then edging upward slightly and finally settling in the low-4s by the early 2030s. Overall, felonies are expected to remain relatively low with gentle ups and downs, while misdemeanors show a much clearer long-term decline.
