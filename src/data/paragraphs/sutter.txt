In Sutter County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents were in the high 20s around 2015 and dipped slightly in 2016 before rising into the low 30s by the late 2010s. After a brief drop around 2019–2020, the rate climbed again, with a noticeable spike in 2022, where it approached the high 30s. The forecast keeps misdemeanor rates generally in the high 20s to low 30s through the late 2020s and into the early 2030s, with some pronounced ups and downs rather than a smooth trend. The blue band is wide, especially in later years, suggesting that future misdemeanor levels could range from the high teens to the mid-30s, and overall, the county is expected to see continued fluctuation rather than a clear long-term decline.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents in Sutter County started around the low-to-mid 10s in 2015, edged up near 2017, then moved down again around 2019–2020, before a sharp spike in 2021, when the rate briefly reached the mid-teens. After that peak, observed felony rates dropped back into the single digits by the early 2020s. The projection shows a gradual decline into the mid-2020s, followed by a cyclical pattern with dips into the mid-single digits and rebounds around 2029 and again in the early 2030s. The confidence interval widens in these later years, suggesting that future felony rates could range from the mid-single digits to the low-teens. Overall, Sutter County shows recent softening in both misdemeanors and felonies, but the forecasts point to ongoing volatility rather than a steady downward path.
