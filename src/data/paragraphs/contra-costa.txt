County of Contra Costa has approximately between 9-10 misdemeanors per 1,000 residents and approximately 51/2-6 total felony per 1,000 residents, which is in the moderate range today, compared to Alameda and of course worse than heavier-crime counties such as Butte. It is estimated that within the next four years, the misdemeanors will decline to the levels of the 2-3rd middle digits per 1,000, whereas the number of felonies is predicted to decrease to 2-3 per 1,000 or even less, which would make Contra Costa one of the 2-3 safer large urban counties in the state in case the tendency continues. The felony forecast then wiggles to very low values in the future, this is a sign of model noise and not any real hope that Contra Costa would reach the low-crime side of the distribution. Therefore, Contra Costa is on a very strong upward-improving path and is expected to shift toward the low-crimes side of the distribution as compared to other counties.
