In Sacramento County, misdemeanors per 1,000 residents started in the high teens around 2015 and then trended downward overall. They fell into the low-teens by 2017, edged back up slightly in the late 2010s, and then dropped more sharply to the high single digits around 2020–2022. After a brief increase in the early 2020s, the forecast shows misdemeanors leveling off in the low-teens through the mid-2020s before gradually declining again, reaching the high single digits by the late 2020s and the mid-single digits by the early 2030s. The blue confidence interval is fairly wide but generally stays below the earlier mid-teens levels, indicating an overall expectation of lower misdemeanor rates than those seen in the mid-2010s.

Total felonies per 1,000 residents began in the low-9s around 2015 and have followed a steady downward path. By the early 2020s, felony rates were in the high-7s, and they continued to decline into the low-7s by the mid-2020s. The projections suggest a further drop into the mid-5s to low-4s by the late 2020s, with noticeable but temporary spikes around 2029 and again near 2033. Even with these bumps, the forecast keeps felonies well below their initial values, pointing to a long-term reduction in felony rates for Sacramento County.
